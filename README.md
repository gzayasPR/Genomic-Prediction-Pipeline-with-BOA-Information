# Genomic-Prediction-Pipeline-with-BOA-Information
This pipeline is designed for genomic prediction in beef crossbreed cattle, incorporating Breed of Origin Alleles (BOA) information to enhance prediction accuracy.  The pipeline integrates genomics and bioinformatics tools to analyze genomic data, predict breeding values, and assess breed composition and origins of alleles.
